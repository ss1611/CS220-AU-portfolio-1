Within the development of website via internet, there is a plenty of people have decided to be  cypercitizens through creating accounts on different social media platforms such as Facebook.As result of it, people get to konw and communicate with different people from different parts of world instead of face-to-face way. Therefore, those people get their own digital identites.As to digital indentity, it is a concept in cyberspace. It refers to the description of a group of individuals or things (sometimes referred to as subject or entity)Data, or all the information about a person available on the Internetsum. It is a type of network used by individuals, organizations or electronic devices.An online identity, or network identity. These individuals, organizations or telecom Sub-devices may have more than one number through different online communities identity. These digital identities are composed of some characteristics or digital attributes.Thus, digital identity provides us with a virtual social circle so that those people can be found by their "footprints".

### My future digital identity/identities
To help develop my digital identities I have
- revised my current use of digital identities (thought about it critically)
- discussed it with my cohort/friends/parents
- found this and that in journal papers/books/internet which helped me understand where and how I could improve 
- used a [SWOT](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=swot&t=brave&ia=web) analysis (or another method that can help personal development) to understand my next steps
- etc. 

Note: Make sure you not only write about what you think needs improving, but also about what you think you are already doing well already regarding your digital identities. A good starting point is to talk about the good things you already do and then dive into what needs improving. In the next heading, you can list the aspects of your identities that need improving and then write about what ideas/methods you plan to use to improve them. 

After identifying and analysing my current use of digital identities on the Web, I set the goal to ...

<br>

#### Objective 1 (example)
The above V&R map and its analysis highlighted ...

To address this (objective/weakness/threat, ...) I plan to 
- do this and that (read this and that, join a specific forum, amend/delete/add this or that, ...)
- by this deadline (perhaps you could write that you will set aside 1 hour every Monday to work on this objective)

<br>

#### Objective 2 (example)
...

By addressing these objectives my V&R map will look as follows:

### Summery
This writing reflected (or in this writing I reflected) on my understanding of

1. digital identities in general and highlighted this and that
2. my digital identities in the past/present and highlighted this and that
3. my digital identities in the future and highlighted this and that

### Questions you should/could export 
- do I know people who are much older than me and can use technology efficiently e.g. the Web more efficiently?
- what does it actually mean "to use the Web more efficiently"?
- what's the difference between White et al.'s and Prensky's idea regarding people engaging with technology?
- on the V&R map, what's the fundamental difference between 'visitor' modes and 'resident' modes and what does the 'personal on institutional' dimension provide?
- how have I been using digital technology in different contexts i.e. how has my 'digital journey' changed since my first device e.g. the one given to me by parents?
- how can/should I (or shouldn't) link my personal identities to my professional identities?
- what implications do my visitor identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my personal identities have on my professional/institutional life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my professional/institutional life?
- how do I assess the credibility of information of other people (or institutions) e.g. does it matter how good their profile picture looks or how well their website is designed? 
- how much fact-checking could people do when visiting my resident identities e.g. my websites or social accounts and who much fact-checking do I need to do when referencing others' work?
- is a piece of information's creditably in line with how high the information ranks using a search engine?
- is a piece of information's creditably in line with the creditability (or the number of followers) of a mainstream or alternative broadcaster, its references and perhaps who it was reviewed by? Can this information be biased or could there be a conflict of interest? 
- what does it mean to critically evaluate information i.e. what is critical thinking?
- how do I develop my critical thinking regarding my engagement on the Web in my visitor and resident modes?
- what is my digital capability e.g. what aspect of technology am I comfortable/uncomfortable with?
- how can I improve my online presence e.g. by monitoring the time I spend on social media vs. work when using my computing device?
- how can I improve the way I interact with information online e.g. can I access a more mindful/objective instead of a more reactive/emotional/biased state of mind before sharing or commenting on something online?
- what information about my developing digital identities am I confident sharing publicly?

### Thoughts
- maybe also have the two maps next to each other for easy comparison
