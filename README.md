## Log

- 2021/10/05 .... 
- 2021/10/01 decided to use GitHub Pages to create a website

## TODO
### website
1. check what other students have done: https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220-AU-portfolio/network/members
2. work on my own website

### di-reflection (essay)
1. revise what digital indenties are
- https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world/blob/main/digital-identities.md
    -  watch the videos and read comments
    -  read about the VR map: http://daveowhite.com/vandr/vr-mapping/
2. check di-identity template made by Kris: https://github.com/2008773/CS220-AU-portfolio/blob/main/di-reflection.md
3. start working on my first V&R map (past use of my digital identities)
4. based on my first V&R map come up with a plan/strategy to further develop the way I use my digital identities online (perhaps focus on your professional-resident digital identities). Remember that the website I develop is part of my 2nd V&R map's 4th quadrant (professional/resident) 
5. finish the essay (ask for peer-review from Emma)
