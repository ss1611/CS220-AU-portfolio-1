# CS220 AU portfolio
## Overview
This is a overview for my portfolio which centres around myself and my interests, both academically and outside of university.

It demonstrates the use of [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for
- a personal website
- writing articles
- web-design with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- self-and peer-assessment
- final checklist 

The URL of the website, using the `index.md` file can be found in the sidebar of this repository, under 'About'. It is a home page that contains my website.

## Portfolio items
The portfolio items I will submit contains the following:

1. **website** - a simple website that supports my institutional/professional identity, also similar to a blog format highlighting non instituional interests. There is also a CV like element to it, showing my education, work experience and essay's written. I have decided to use github over other sites such as WIX as the simplictly and CV like formatting with markdown works more effective at conveying the precise and efficient clarity that I want the reader to see.
2. **di reflection** - a short written work (essay) where I reflect on developing my digital identities including both, visitor and resident modes (White, 2013). I wrote my reflection in Word, however I submitted it as a PDF file on FASER. 
3. **self-and peer-assessment** - Using the CS220 AU marking rubric in the `assessment.md` file my peer and I helped to streamline my progress. Evaluating my work and giving feedback to my peers' work.
4. **portfolio overview** - This is the portfolio overview, where I outline my completed tasks (Log) and tasks to do (TODO) in the `README.md` file.

I have added my student number and portfolio's URL in the `final-check.md` file, complete a checklist in this file and along with the PDF version of your DI reflection, submit it on FASER. 

I have submitted my files, like this:

1. 2001057-di-reflection.pdf
2. 2001057-final-check.md
