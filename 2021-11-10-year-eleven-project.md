# Year 11 Citizenship project: inspiring a sociological imagination.

In the final year of secondary school, part of my Citizenship course required me to raise awareness on a prominent form of social injustice. During 2017 - two years prior to the completion of my project - [the number of rough sleepers in the South of England had risen by 194% on 2010's levels](https://www.crisis.org.uk/media/238700/homelessness_monitor_england_2018.pdf), illustrating a need for action regarding homelessness in the UK. Thus, my Citizenship project was directed at alerting people to the damaging effects of homelessness and funding the work of the Colchester Night Shelter.

After peer discussion, I decided upon a charity bake sale in order to raise money for the Colchester Night Shelter, teaming up with my peers to inform the members of my school on the importance of reducing the rapidly increasing homelessness rate, and providing charities with the means to assist rough sleepers through funds derived from cakes from the sale.

At the end of the bake sale, over £74 was raised for the Colchester Night Shelter!

If interested, explore the [Colchester Night Shelter](https://colchesternightshelter.org.uk) website for futher information on homelessness in the Colchester vicinity.

From this point, my interest in social inequalities was primed, hence I desired to explore them further by taking A level Sociology at the Colchester Sixth Form, in hopes of gaining insight into the ways in which power relations within society are unequally balanced.
