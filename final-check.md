### General
I made sure that
- [x] my GitHub username matches my student number
- [ ] my repository to submit is named 'CS220-AU-portfolio'

### Website
I used the `index.md` file 
- [ ] to support one of my own professional/institutional identities (or projects) and used the GitHub Pages function to turn this file into a website. I understand that as an alternative to GitHub Pages, I could have used another content management system e.g. WordPress to create my website and that I could have added additional pages if essential.
- [ ] I provided a URL to my website in my repository's sidebar

### DI Reflection
- [ ] I wrote my reflection on digital identities focusing on developing my own digital identities 
- [ ] I used Chicago style referencing
- [ ] I converted my file into a PDF and renamed it to reflect my student number e.g. '0610279-di-reflection.PDF' 
- [ ] I understand that this reflection could also be added to my website using the `di-reflection.md` file if I feel that its content is safe for public dissemination
